description=[h2]Add-On for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3058279917]GameNight[/url].[/h2]
description=[h3]Two rival handlers each have a new spy, and are tasked with introducing them to their fellow agents covertly.[/h3]
description=[i]The new spy can only use clues and covert names to discern who is friend of foe. To win, your team will need to make contact with all of your spies before the other team can. Watch out for the neutral civilians and enemies or else your turn is over; even worse if you run into the assassin â€“ your team loses! [/i]
